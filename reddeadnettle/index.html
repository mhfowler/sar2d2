        <p>
            this web page is being served from a raspberry pi <a href="img/rpi.jpg">on a shelf</a> inside of sari-sari
        </p>
        <p>
            this raspberry pi also runs a scuttlebutt pub <br/>
        </p>
        <p> scuttlebutt is a decentralized social network <br>(<a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/about/">here</a> is a more detailed explanation if you're curious),<br>
            and this pub is like one doorway into it
        <p>
            if you would like to join, <br>
            send me a message any way you can reach me<br>
            and I'll send you an invite which you can use to connect
        </p>
        <p>
            once you are connected you can use it as you see fit, <br>but I'm going to share here a little bit here
            about what I appreciate about it
        </p>
        <p>
            to me it feels like a learning group for community resilience
        </p>
        <p>
            farming, fabrication, community organizing,
            permaculture, solarpower, sailing, mycology
        </p>
        <p>
            I imagine larping that the global supply chain does not exist as a way to prepare for its collapse, <br>
            and to heal ourselves and become less alienated in the process
        </p>
        <p>
            this learning group sometimes takes structured forms, a group of people intentionally studying a topic together,
            and sometimes it takes the form of self-study, and sharing updates of what you are researching along the way
        </p>
        <p>
            if you are interested in studying these topics together and connecting with people with similar interests,  <br>(and slowly building a collaborative network of healing community spaces),<br>
         I hope this can be a space to facilitate that
        </p>
        <p>
            i imagine wires connecting us directly that weave between and around the malls we often meet in
       </p>
<!--       <p>-->
<!--            its like a local internet, hosted by friends-->
<!--        </p>-->
        <p>
            in the future you can also ask other people running pubs for invites<br> so you don't depend on this pub for connectivity either
